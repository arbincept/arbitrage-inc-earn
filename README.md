A multi-protocol yield aggregator and vault manager on BNB Smart Chain, designed to streamline entry into top DeFi yield strategies.

**Live Application:** [https://arbitrage-inc-earn.vercel.app](https://arbitrage-inc-earn.vercel.app)  
**Main Platform:** [https://arbitrage-inc.exchange](https://arbitrage-inc.exchange)

### Live UI Preview

![Arbitrage Inc Earn live vault explorer](./docs/live-vaults.png)

This capture shows the public vault explorer and live strategy cards before wallet connection. Rates, positions and availability can change with the underlying protocols.

## Demo & Concrete Example

Try the [live Earn application](https://arbitrage-inc-earn.vercel.app) to inspect the vault interface on BNB Smart Chain. The application is read-only until a user connects a wallet and explicitly signs a transaction.

Example workflow:

1. Select a supported liquid-staking or lending destination.
2. Review the required asset, route, estimated output and displayed protocol data.
3. Connect a wallet and sign only after checking the target protocol and transaction details.

Supported integrations and displayed yield data can change; this repository does not guarantee returns.

## Overview

Arbitrage Inception Vaults aggregates prominent yield-bearing protocols on BNB Chain into a single non-custodial interface. Through direct integration with the **KyberSwap Aggregation API**, users can deposit into liquid staking and lending positions using native BNB or any supported token with automated route calculation and single-transaction execution.

### Key Capabilities:
- **DeFi "Zap" Composition:** Single-action swap and deposit. Converts any input token to the required vault underlying asset before executing contract calls.
- **Lending Markets Interaction:** Direct supply and mint calls to **Venus Protocol** money market contracts (`vTokenAbi`, `vUSDT`, `vUSDC`).
- **Liquid Staking Integration:** Seamless staking flows for **Lista DAO**, **pSTAKE Finance**, and **Stader Labs**.
- **Modern EVM Tooling:** Built using **Viem** and **Wagmi v2** for type-safe contract calls, fast RPC state reconciliation, and minimal bundle footprint.

## Supported Protocols & Vaults

- **Liquid Staking:**
  - **Lista DAO** (`slisBNB`): Liquid staked BNB earning protocol staking yields.
  - **pSTAKE Finance** (`stkBNB`): Auto-compounding BNB staking rewards.
  - **Stader Labs** (`BNBx`): Liquid staking with automated compound rewards.
- **Lending Markets:**
  - **Venus Protocol** (`vUSDT`, `vUSDC`): Decentralized money market supply with automated swap and deposit logic.
